I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Program for Applied and Computational Mathematics [(PACM)](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University in the group of [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/). My research focuses on developing novel image and signal processing algorithms with an emphasis on application to electron microscopy. 

Prior to joining PACM, I obtained a B.S. in Chemical and Biological Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder (2015) and a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin (2021). My PhD advisors were [Dr. David Taylor](http://cryoem.cns.utexas.edu/) and [Dr. Edward Marcotte](http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page). During my PhD, I developed methods that combined mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to investigate the 3-D structure of proteins directly from cell lysates.
