I am a DataX Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Program for Applied and Computational Mathematics [(PACM)](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University in the group of [Amit Singer](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amits/). My research interests broadly include the mathematics of data science and signal processing. In particular I focus on developing metrics and algorithms with solid mathematical foundations that can be applied to imaging techniques like cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).


Prior to joining PACM, I obtained a B.S. in Chemical and Biological Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder and a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin. During my PhD, I developed experimental and computational methods to establish a data-driven approach to structural biology by combining large multi-modal datasets. My PhD advisors were [Dr. Edward Marcotte](http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page) and [Dr. David Taylor](https://davidtaylorlab.com/).
