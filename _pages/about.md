I am a PhD student in the [Department of Molecular Biosciences](https://cns.utexas.edu/about/facts/molecular-biosciences) at the University of Texas at Austin. The focus of my research is applications of single particle cryoEM for studying protein interactions directly from extracts of cells. My PhD advisors are [Dr. David Taylor](http://cryoem.cns.utexas.edu/) and [Dr. Edward Marcotte](http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page). Before coming to UT, I recieved my B.S. in Chemical and Biological Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
